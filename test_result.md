# Testing Protocol and Results

## Original User Problem Statement
The user requested a "Revisão Final" (Final Review) of a fitness/training management platform. The platform is designed for personal trainers to manage students, track progress, create workouts, and facilitate communication between trainers and students.

## Current Status
- **Frontend**: React with Vite running on port 8080 ✅
- **Backend**: Missing - needs to be created ❌
- **Database**: MongoDB running but not connected ❌
- **Authentication**: Using mock data ❌

## Testing Protocol
1. **Backend Testing**: Always test backend first using `deep_testing_cloud` tool
2. **Frontend Testing**: Only test frontend with explicit user permission
3. **Always read and update this file before invoking testing agents**
4. **Never fix something already fixed by testing agents**

## Development Progress
### Phase 1: Technical Corrections (In Progress)
- ✅ Frontend service is running successfully
- ❌ Backend needs to be created from scratch
- ❌ Environment variables need to be configured
- ❌ Database connection needs to be established

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Create FastAPI backend structure
2. Configure environment variables
3. Set up database models and connections
4. Replace mock data with real API calls

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User gave full autonomy ("Faca o que for melhor" - Do what's best)
- Focus on getting core functionality working first
- Prioritize backend creation and database integration
